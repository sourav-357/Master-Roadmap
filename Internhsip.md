## 🧩 DSA Roadmap (GFG Self‑Paced)

`01 Intro → 02 Maths → 03 Bit Magic → 04 Recursion → 05 Arrays → 06 Searching (done)`  
`Next: 07 Sorting → 08 Matrix → 09 Hashing → 10 Strings → 11 Linked List → 12 Stack → 13 Queue → 14 Deque → 15 Tree → 16 BST → 17 Heap → 18 Graph → 19 Greedy → 20 Backtracking → 21 DP → 22 Trie → 23 Segment Tree/BIT → 24 Disjoint Set`[file:32]

## 📦 Projects Roadmap (3 Separate → 1 Flagship Later)

1. **Project A – LMS**  
   Student / Instructor / Admin LMS with auth, course CRUD, enrollments, and quizzes.

2. **Project B – SaaS Analytics Platform**  
   Multi‑tenant dashboards (institutes), analytics, and mock payments (Stripe/Razorpay test).

3. **Project C – Real‑Time Course Chat**  
   Socket.io‑based real‑time chat integrated into LMS/SaaS (course rooms, online status).

> Later, these three become **one flagship Edu‑SaaS product** on your resume.
