## 🎯 How to Apply Smart (So You Actually Get Paid)

- **Targeted filtering:**  
  - Internshala: use filters (WFH, Computer Science/IT, Web / Full Stack, stipend ≥ 5k). 
  - LinkedIn: save searches `"SDE intern remote"`, `"Full Stack Intern remote"`, `"MERN intern"` and set alerts. 
  - Wellfound: focus on startups with funding or decent salary ranges. 
- **Application message template:**  
  - 3–4 lines: what you know (MERN + DSA), 3 live projects links, why you fit their JD, availability & duration.  
- **Referrals:**  
  - For each company you apply to on LinkedIn, check employees → alumni/seniors → send 1–2 polite messages for referral.  
- **Consistency rule:**  
  - Minimum 10–15 solid applications **every single day**, plus 3–5 follow-ups to older ones.

## 🧠 Extra Advice to Be Internship-Ready

- Focus on **clarity of explanation** more than fancy features; interviewers judge how you think.  
- Every week, record yourself explaining:  
  - One DSA problem (approach + complexity).  
  - One feature of LMS/SaaS/Chat (architecture, trade-offs).  
- Sleep, health, and a little exercise will keep your brain sharp; fever recovery first, then push hard.  
- Never skip mocks – they compress interview experience into weeks instead of years.

---

> **💪 Final Note:** Stick to this corrected plan (with **Greedy as Part 19**) and keep executing daily; with 3 strong projects and 500+ DSA problems, you will be **paid remote SDE-internship ready** by the end of this 14‑week sprint.
