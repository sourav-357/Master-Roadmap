Perfect. You’ve got a clear target — **20+ LPA at a FAANG-tier company**, off-campus — which means you’re competing at the top 1% level. So, no fluff. Let’s map out *exactly* what it takes, and what to master step by step.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Land a **Software Development Engineer (SDE/SWE)** role at a **FAANG** (or FAANG-level) company through **off-campus** routes — salary target: **₹20+ LPA**.

---

## 🧭 Core Roadmap Overview

You’ll need to master **5 pillars**:

1. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
2. **Computer Science Fundamentals**
3. **Development & Projects (Proof of Skill)**
4. **System Design & Scalability (for big interviews)**
5. **Interview Strategy & Resume/LinkedIn Optimization**

---

## 🧩 1. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This is the foundation — you *must* be elite here.

### 📚 Topics to Master

#### Arrays & Strings

* Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum
* Kadanes, Subarray problems, Rotations

#### Linked List

* Reversal, Merge, Cycle detection, LRU Cache logic

#### Stack & Queue

* Next Greater/Smaller, Monotonic Stack, Min Stack
* Queue with two stacks, circular queue, deque

#### Trees

* Traversals, BST operations, Diameter, LCA
* Binary Tree ↔ Doubly Linked List

#### Graphs

* BFS, DFS, Topo Sort, Dijkstra, Union-Find (DSU)
* Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal/Prim)
* Graph coloring, Cycle detection, Strongly connected components

#### Recursion & Backtracking

* Subsets, Permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku Solver

#### DP (Dynamic Programming)

* 1D: Fibonacci, House Robber, Jump Game
* 2D: Knapsack, Grid Paths, LCS, Matrix Chain
* Pattern-based thinking (memoization → tabulation → space optimization)

#### Greedy

* Intervals, Activity Selection, Huffman Encoding

#### Heap / Priority Queue

* Top-K problems, Merge K lists, Median finder

#### Bit Manipulation

* Subsets generation, XOR tricks, Single Number

---

### 🏋️ Practice Platforms

* **LeetCode (Main)** – focus here.
* **Codeforces** – for speed + problem-solving mindset.
* **GeeksforGeeks** – for concept revision.
* **InterviewBit** – for structured problem paths.

#### Suggested Targets

* 300+ quality LeetCode problems (covering all patterns)
* At least **2 contests per week** on Codeforces or LeetCode.
* Maintain a **streak-based system** (consistency beats volume).

## 🧠 2. Core CS Subjects

These are non-negotiable for FAANG interviews.

| Subject                    | Key Topics                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OS (Operating Systems)** | Process vs Thread, Deadlocks, Scheduling, Paging, Semaphores           |
| **DBMS**                   | Normalization, Joins, Indexing, Transactions, ACID, Isolation Levels   |
| **OOPs**                   | Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Design Patterns |
| **CN (Computer Networks)** | TCP vs UDP, OSI model, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, Load Balancing                 |

➡ **Tip:** Learn from GFG, Neso Academy, and use YouTube playlists from Gate Smashers / CodeWithHarry (for quick revision).

## 💻 3. Development & Projects (Proof of Skill)

This is where most fail in off-campus hiring. You must **show you can build**.

### 🔧 Core Stack Options

Pick **ONE** of these paths and go deep:

#### 🧱 Web Dev (most common)

* Frontend: React, Next.js
* Backend: Node.js + Express / NestJS
* Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
* Add authentication, file uploads, caching, deployment (AWS/Vercel)
* Optional: Docker, CI/CD, testing (Jest)

#### 🤖 AI / ML (only if you're genuinely interested)

* Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* Build 3–4 solid models (classification, regression, NLP)
* Showcase via Streamlit dashboards or Flask APIs

#### 📱 App Dev

* Kotlin/Flutter/React Native apps with APIs and local storage.

### 🧩 Project Guidelines

Build **3–5 high-impact projects**, such as:

* Scalable Chat App (WebSocket, Redis, Node.js)
* Real-time Collaboration Tool (like Google Docs)
* E-commerce System (microservices + caching)
* URL shortener (with analytics)
* ML project deployed on cloud

**Make all projects public on GitHub** and add proper README, live link, and short video demo.

---

## ⚙️ 4. System Design (after 5th sem)

FAANG interviews often test system thinking.

* **Start small:** design URL shortener, cache, notification service
* **Then:** scalable systems – Twitter feed, Uber backend, Instagram architecture
* **Resources:**

  * “Grokking the System Design Interview”
  * “System Design Primer” (GitHub)
  * YouTube: Gaurav Sen, ByteByteGo

---

## 📄 5. Interview Prep, Resume, and Strategy

### 🧾 Resume

* One-page, crisp, action verbs (“Built,” “Optimized,” “Deployed”)
* Quantify results: “Reduced API latency by 40%”
* Add GitHub + LinkedIn + Portfolio links

### 🔍 Off-Campus Strategy

* Apply on **LinkedIn**, **Indeed**, **AngelList**, **YCombinator startups**
* **Use Referrals:** Connect with engineers, send short messages
* Participate in **hackathons (Devpost, HackerEarth, Unstop)** – often lead to offers
* Track openings via **Otta**, **Relevel**, **HackerRank Jobs**

### 💬 Mock Interviews

* Do **10–20 mocks** on Pramp / peers / Discord communities.
* Record and analyze your mistakes.

## 🕒 6. Timeline (Starting Now)

You’re in **3rd sem** → ideal timeline:

| Semester    | Focus                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **3rd–4th** | DSA (daily), OS/DBMS, 1 Dev project                        |
| **5th–6th** | Strong projects + minor internships + System Design basics |
| **7th**     | Heavy interview grind + mock interviews + apply off-campus |

---

## 🚀 Daily Routine (Sample)

| Time          | Focus                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 6:00–9:00 AM  | DSA practice (2 problems/day)    |
| 9:00–2:00 PM  | Classes / college                |
