# Master-Roadmap

A **single, battle-ready roadmap** you can follow start-to-finish. split it exactly:

* **DSA plan (one place)** — daily/weekly cadence, month-by-month targets.
* **Technology roadmap (sequence-wise, numbered)** — every tech you actually *need*, with **what it is**, **why it matters**, **deliverable(s)** and **practical resources**.
* **Timelines** for every item and exact guidance on when to open-source, apply for internships, and run projects.
* I kept it focused — **core required first**, then **high-value extras** (AI/infra). No fluff.

I also checked current industry signals (popularity and trends) so this list is aligned to what’s being used and hired for today. Key trend summary below (sources included). ([stackoverflow.blog][1])

# Executive summary — what to learn (short)

1. **DSA** — do this every day; it’s mandatory for product roles.
2. **Frontend** — HTML, CSS, JavaScript → React → Next.js. (Deliver: polished portfolio + 1 full-stack app)
3. **Backend** — Node.js (JS) → Express / NestJS → databases (Postgres + Mongo) → TypeScript. (Deliver: production-like API)
4. **DevOps basics** — GitHub Actions, Docker, deploy on AWS. (Deliver: CI/CD pipeline + deployed service)
5. **Infra & scale (later)** — Kubernetes, Terraform, monitoring, message queues. (Deliver: microservices on k8s)
6. **AI/ML product skills (edge)** — embeddings, LangChain, vector DBs for RAG. (Deliver: RAG chatbot)
7. **System Design + Core CS** — OS, DB internals, networking, LLD/HLD practice. (Ongoing)
8. **Soft skills** — OSS contributions, internships, mock interviews, resume/blogs.

Trends that justify these priorities: Python & TypeScript growth (AI + safer JS), continued dominance of JS for web, Kubernetes/cloud-native adoption, and fast uptake of vector DBs for RAG apps. ([stackoverflow.blog][1])

# Part A — DSA (all-in-one plan)

You said you’ll do DSA “inside-wise” — here’s the compact, no-fluff program.

**Goal:** 12–18 months → be comfortable with medium → hard LeetCode + 500 quality problems over time.

**Daily**

* **60–120 min**: focused practice (one topic per day). Start with arrays/strings → two-pointers → hashmaps → sliding window → stacks/queues → trees → graphs → dp → greedy/heaps → sorting/searching.
* **1 timed LeetCode problem (45–60 min)** 3×/week (simulate interview pressure).

**Weekly**

* **1 mock session** (90–120 min): 2 problems (one medium, one hard) + code review.
* **1 contest** (Codeforces/CodeChef) every 1–2 weeks (optional, huge long-term benefit).

**Monthly targets**

* Month 1–3: Master arrays/strings/hashmaps + 150 easy→medium problems.
* Month 4–9: Trees/graphs + medium problems (200 more).
* Month 10–15: Dynamic programming, advanced graphs, tough mediums/hards (150-200).
* Ongoing: Review patterns, redo mistakes, do timed mocks.

**Resources**

* **GeeksforGeeks** (concepts & your course).
* **LeetCode** (practice + premium patterns if you can).
* **NeetCode / Blind 75** (pattern lists).
* **System design** (see below) — starts after you have backend basics.

**Deliverables (DSA)**

* Completed folders on GitHub with solved problems (well-commented).
* 3 timed mock recordings / transcripts showing improvement.

# Prioritization: what to learn first (short)

1. HTML → CSS → JS (ES6) → Git → React → Node (JS) → Postgres/Mongo → TypeScript → Docker → Tests → Deploy to AWS. (All **Core**.)
2. After core: Kubernetes, Terraform, Redis, Kafka, Observability. (Add **High-value** afterward.)
3. AI features (LangChain, vector DBs) — start after you can deploy and run infra reliably (useful as differentiator for 20+ LPA).

---

# Timeline (high-level, start Nov 15, 2025)

* **Nov 15 → Feb 2026 (3.5 months):** Foundations — HTML/CSS/JS/React basics/Git + DSA 60–90 min/day. Portfolio + 1 full-stack mini app.
* **Mar → Jun 2026 (4 months):** Backend fundamentals — Node (JS), Express, MongoDB, Postgres+Prisma; start internships applications (Feb–Mar window). Begin OSS contributions mid-2026.
* **Jul → Dec 2026 (6 months):** Productionize — TypeScript conversion, testing, Docker, Redis, CI/CD, AWS deploy. Start hackathons Apr 2026 onward.
* **Jan → Jun 2027 (6 months):** Infra & scale — k8s, Terraform, observability, message queues.
* **Jul 2027 → Jun 2028 (12 months):** Flagship projects (E-Commerce microservices + RAG chatbot), heavy system design, mock interviews, targeted job applications.
* **Jul → Nov 2028:** Final hiring push / placement season.

(Adjust pace if you’re faster/slower — but keep DSA ongoing.)

---

# When to open-source, internships, hackathons (exact)

* **Start OSS:** **Mid-2026** (after Node + Git foundations). Begin with docs/tests PRs → feature PRs by Q4 2026.
* **Apply internships:** **Start Feb–Mar 2026** for Summer 2026. Keep applying rolling through 2027.
* **Hackathons:** **From Apr 2026** once you have 1 full-stack app; aim for 3+ events in 2026 (good wins + network).
* **Flagship projects for resume:** Start building end of **2026** and through **2027**.

---

# Deliverable list you must show publicly (minimum)

1. **Portfolio site** (live) — home, projects, contact.
2. **GitHub** with 3 main repos: front-end app, backend API, infrastructure (Docker + Terraform).
3. **Deployed staging URL** (AWS/Vercel) for at least one project.
4. **TypeScript-converted API** in strict mode.
5. **CI** that runs tests on PRs.
6. **Microservices on k8s** (demo or local + doc).
7. **RAG demo** (hosted or video demo).
8. **3 technical blog posts** describing architecture + decisions + metrics.

---

# Practical study resources (quick list by tech)

* **HTML/CSS/JS:** MDN Web Docs.
* **React/Next.js:** Official docs + your Udemy React & Next.js courses.
* **Node/Express:** ZTM Node course, Jonas Schmedtmann.
* **MongoDB:** Maximilian course; Mongo docs.
* **Postgres/Prisma:** Prisma docs + Postgres docs.
* **TypeScript:** TypeScript handbook + strict tsconfig guides.
* **Docker:** Docker docs (multi-stage builds).
* **Kubernetes:** k8s docs + minikube tutorials.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions docs.
* **DSA:** GeeksforGeeks (course you’re on) + LeetCode + NeetCode.

# Final blunt advice — what I’ll not sugarcoat

* **Do DSA daily**. Great projects + zero DSA = no invite to most product interviews.
* **Don’t learn TypeScript first.** Learn Node in JS → convert to TS. You’ve already got that in your earlier plan — keep it.
* **Don’t spread yourself too thin early.** Focus: Frontend + Backend + 1 deployed project. Add infra after you can deploy and maintain a service.
* **Use internships & OSS as proof.** Real experience beats certificates. Apply early and often.
