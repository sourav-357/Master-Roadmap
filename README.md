<br>

## 💻 3. Development & Projects (Proof of Skill)

This is where most fail in off-campus hiring. You must **show you can build**.

### 🔧 Core Stack Options

Pick **ONE** of these paths and go deep:

#### 🧱 Web Dev (most common)

* Frontend: React, Next.js
* Backend: Node.js + Express / NestJS
* Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
* Add authentication, file uploads, caching, deployment (AWS/Vercel)
* Optional: Docker, CI/CD, testing (Jest)

#### 🤖 AI / ML (only if you're genuinely interested)

* Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
* Build 3–4 solid models (classification, regression, NLP)
* Showcase via Streamlit dashboards or Flask APIs

#### 📱 App Dev

* Kotlin/Flutter/React Native apps with APIs and local storage.

### 🧩 Project Guidelines

Build **3–5 high-impact projects**, such as:

* Scalable Chat App (WebSocket, Redis, Node.js)
* Real-time Collaboration Tool (like Google Docs)
* E-commerce System (microservices + caching)
* URL shortener (with analytics)
* ML project deployed on cloud

**Make all projects public on GitHub** and add proper README, live link, and short video demo.

<br>

---

<br>

## ⚙️ 4. System Design (after 5th sem)

FAANG interviews often test system thinking.

* **Start small:** design URL shortener, cache, notification service
* **Then:** scalable systems – Twitter feed, Uber backend, Instagram architecture
* **Resources:**

  * “Grokking the System Design Interview”
  * “System Design Primer” (GitHub)
  * YouTube: Gaurav Sen, ByteByteGo

<br>

---

<br>

## 📄 5. Interview Prep, Resume, and Strategy

### 🧾 Resume

* One-page, crisp, action verbs (“Built,” “Optimized,” “Deployed”)
* Quantify results: “Reduced API latency by 40%”
* Add GitHub + LinkedIn + Portfolio links

### 🔍 Off-Campus Strategy

* Apply on **LinkedIn**, **Indeed**, **AngelList**, **YCombinator startups**
* **Use Referrals:** Connect with engineers, send short messages
* Participate in **hackathons (Devpost, HackerEarth, Unstop)** – often lead to offers
* Track openings via **Otta**, **Relevel**, **HackerRank Jobs**

### 💬 Mock Interviews

* Do **10–20 mocks** on Pramp / peers / Discord communities.
* Record and analyze your mistakes.

<br>

# Prioritization: what to learn first (short)

1. HTML → CSS → JS (ES6) → Git → React → Node (JS) → Postgres/Mongo → TypeScript → Docker → Tests → Deploy to AWS. (All **Core**.)
2. After core: Kubernetes, Terraform, Redis, Kafka, Observability. (Add **High-value** afterward.)
3. AI features (LangChain, vector DBs) — start after you can deploy and run infra reliably (useful as differentiator for 20+ LPA).
4.

# Projects — exact set, sequence, and deadlines (build these *in this order*)

You must have **2 flagship projects** (one simple, one complex). Each must be deployed, typed (TS where possible), have tests, CI, and a clear README + architecture doc.

### Project A (MUST, finish by **end of Foundations**)

* **Type:** Full-stack CRUD app (React + Next.js front, Node/Express + Postgres/Mongo backend).
* **Examples:** Job portal / Notes app with auth & roles.
* **Deliverable:** Live link, GitHub repo, README + deployment guide.
* **Deadline:** By end of Phase 1 (Nov15 → Feb28).

### Project B (FLAGSHIP, finish by **end of Productionize**)

* **Type:** Production-like microservice app. E-commerce microservices or a social app (users, products/posts, payments, search).
* **Must include:** Auth, payments stub, Redis cache, background jobs, Prisma/Postgres, Dockerized, CI, deployed staging.
* **Deliverable:** Live staging, architecture doc (HLD + LLD), performance numbers (p50/p95).
* **Deadline:** By end of Phase 3 (Jul–Dec 2026).

### Project C (OPTIONAL EDGE)

* **Type:** RAG chatbot or search + LLM integration (LangChain + vector DB).
* **Why:** Differentiator for AI product roles.
* **Deadline:** After Projects A & B, Q3–Q4 2027.

<br>

---

<br>

## Hackathons, CP and Contests — WHEN & HOW

* **Start contests:** Month 2 (Dec 2025) — CodeChef/Codeforces monthly participation. Aim 1 contest/2 weeks if possible.
* **Competitive programming:** Optional but beneficial. Do CP for 3–6 months if you want to sharpen speed. Don’t let CF consume your project time.
* **Hackathons:** Start after Project A is deployed (March 2026). Join 2–3 hackathons in next 6 months (Apr–Sep 2026). Use hackathons to:

  * Build quick features for your portfolio.
  * Network & win recognitions → good resume bullets.
* **How to succeed in hackathons:** Keep scope tiny, reuse existing codebase, build one real feature, focus on deployment, prepare a 3-minute demo.

<br>

---

<br>

## Internships — when to apply, what roles, and process

**When to apply:** Rolling from **Feb–Mar 2026** (start applying as soon as you have Project A + ~150 DSA problems). Apply continuously.

**Roles to target:**

* **SDE / Backend Intern (Node/TS/Java)** — prefer Node + Postgres/Mongo.
* **Full-stack Intern** — React + Node.
* **Platform / Tools Intern** — if you have infra skills (later).

**Application process (typical):**

1. **Online test** / coding challenge (HackerEarth/CodeSignal/Company portal).
2. **Technical phone screen** - 1 medium DSA problem + behavioral.
3. **Onsite / Virtual interview** - 2–3 rounds: DSA, system design (small), backend design + behavioral.

**How to apply effectively:**

* Start with targeted companies (startups + product companies) with 2–3 tailored applications/day.
* Use alumni & LinkedIn referrals heavily.
* Keep one “interview-ready” resume version and a short pitch.

<br>

---

<br>

## Resume & LinkedIn — exact checklist (do this before applying)

**Resume**

* One page only. Top 3 bullets first: (1) flagship project + live URL, (2) internships/OSS (if any), (3) DSA achievement / contest rank (if good).
* For each project: one line summary (what it does), tech stack, 2 measurable bullets (what you built + results e.g., 99% test coverage, 1000 monthly users simulated, 200ms p95).
* Skills section: list languages, frameworks, infra. Prioritize those you know well.
* Add links: GitHub, live project URL, LinkedIn.

**LinkedIn**

* Professional headline: “Aspiring SDE | React • Node • Postgres • TypeScript | Looking for internships (Summer 2026)”.
* Summary: 3–4 lines: what you build, what you’re learning, what you want.
* Projects: add repos and short descriptions.
* Post 1 technical writeup every 6–8 weeks.

**Portfolio**

* Home, projects, contact + downloadable resume.

<br>

## EXACT TIMELINE (high-level phases — dates included)

**Phase 0 — Prep (Now → Nov 14, 2025)**

* Read MDN basics, set up GitHub, pick start date, prepare daily schedule.

**Phase 1 — Foundations (Nov 15, 2025 → Feb 28, 2026) — 3.5 months**

* HTML/CSS (2 weeks), JS (6 weeks), React (6 weeks overlapping), Project A deployed, Git, DSA daily.
* **Milestone**: Live portfolio + Project A + 150 DSA problems.

**Phase 2 — Backend Core (Mar 1 → Jun 30, 2026) — 4 months**

* Node + Express, Postgres + Prisma, Mongo basics, Docker, basic tests. Start applying internships (Feb–Mar window) with Project A. Start OSS small PRs. Continue DSA.
* **Milestone**: REST API deployed + internship interviews ongoing.

**Phase 3 — Productionize (Jul 1 → Dec 31, 2026) — 6 months**

* TypeScript conversion, testing, Dockerized multi-service, Redis + job queue, CI, initial monitoring. Hackathons + OSS contributions. Project B development and deployment begins.
* **Milestone**: Project B deployed (flagship), CI + Docker + tests.

**Phase 4 — System Design & Infra (Jan 1 → Jun 30, 2027) — 6 months**

* System design deep-dive, Kubernetes basics (optional), Terraform basics (optional), advanced cloud features (Lambda/S3). Continue DSA (hard problems).
* **Milestone**: 3 design docs + k8s demo (optional).

**Phase 5 — Flagship & Interview Push (Jul 1, 2027 → Jun 30, 2028) — 12 months**

* Build RAG/demo if desired; heavy mock interviews; targeted applications to product companies; placement/hiring push.
* **Milestone**: 2 flagship projects + 3 blog posts + 50 mock interviews.

**Note:** That full path is ~18–24 months of aggressive, consistent work. If you speed up, you can compress phases, but expect heavy workload.

<br>

---

<br>

## WEEK-BY-WEEK sample (first 12 weeks — actionable daily split)

Average target: **8 hours/day** sustainable (you said 15/day doable — I don’t advise 15/day long-term).

**Weekdays**

* 1.5–2 hr DSA (topic + one problem).
* 2.0–3.0 hr JS/React learning + exercises.
* 1.5–2.0 hr Project work (feature implementation).
* 0.5–1.0 hr GitHub / documentation / small tests.
* 0.5 hr review (error logs, previous mistakes).

**Weekends**

* 3–4 hr deep DSA (timed mock).
* 3–6 hr larger project features & deploy tasks.
* 1–2 hr reading system design / blog writing.

<br>

---

<br>

## Which languages: Java vs C++ vs Python vs JS?

* **Frontend + Backend:** stick with **JavaScript/TypeScript** (React + Node) — fastest to build full-stack.
* **DSA interviews:** Stick with **Java** (you know it); it’s acceptable for FAANG. **C++** gives micro advantage in CP but not necessary. Only switch to C++ if you want to dominate CF problems regularly.
* **When to use Python:** good for prototyping and some interviews, but not needed if you’re comfortable with Java/JS.

<br>

---

<br>

## What to cut / avoid (blunt)

* Don’t do **Kubernetes/Terraform/Prometheus/Kafka/RAG** before you have 2 deployed projects + solid DSA. These are later-phase skills.
* Don’t chase every new tool. Build 2 real deployed projects and tests first.
* Don’t spend >2 weeks on CSS animations — focus on functionality and polish.

<br>

---

<br>

## How to interview & apply — process & schedule

* **Start applying** as soon as Project A + 150 DSA problems are done (end of Phase 1). Apply to internships & junior SDE roles.
* **Target list:** product startups, mid-size product companies, top small FAANG-like companies for internships.
* **Application tempo:** 5–15 applications/day until interviews convert.
* **Interview prep:** 2 weeks before scheduled interviews drop your learning focus and do daily timed LeetCode + mock interviews with peers.

<br>

---

<br>

## Measurable deliverables by checkpoints (so you can verify progress)

**End Phase 1 (Feb 28, 2026):**

* Live portfolio.
* Project A (deployed).
* GitHub with 150 DSA problems.
* 1 solid resume + LinkedIn ready.

**End Phase 2 (Jun 30, 2026):**

* REST API + DB deployed.
* First internship interviews done.
* 250 DSA problems solved.

**End Phase 3 (Dec 31, 2026):**

* Flagship Project B deployed (microservices/CI/Redis).
* OSS contributions started.
* Hackathon wins/mentions (1–2).
* 350–400 DSA problems.

**End Phase 5 (Jun 30, 2028):**

* Multiple interviews cleared, targeted offers, system design strong.

<br>

---

<br>

## Resources (short, practical list)

* **DSA:** LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks (your course), NeetCode, Blind 75.
* **Frontend:** MDN docs, React docs, Next.js docs, Udemy React courses you own.
* **Backend:** ZTM Node course (you have), Jonas Schmedtmann Node bootcamp.
* **DB/ORM:** Postgres docs, Prisma docs, MongoDB docs.
* **TS:** TypeScript Handbook.
* **Docker/AWS:** Docker docs; AWS Free Tier tutorials.
* **Testing:** Jest docs; Supertest; Playwright/Cypress.
* **System design:** Gaurav Sen (YouTube), *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*.
* **RAG/vector:** LangChain docs, pgvector docs (only if pursuing AI product role).

<br>

---

<br>

## Final blunt advice (no drama — what I’d tell myself)

1. **Do Priority A perfectly.** Don’t half-learn things. A solid deployed project + TS + tests + DSA = 80% of hires.
2. **Consistency beats intensity.** 6–8 hrs/day sustained for 18 months > 15 hrs/day for 3 months then burnout.
3. **Apply early and often.** Don’t wait for everything to be perfect to apply for internships from Mar 2026 onward.
4. **Measure weekly:** projects progress, DSA total solved, mock interview count.
